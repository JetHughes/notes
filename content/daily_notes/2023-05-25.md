Opengl

some members of our team decided to use cpp with opengl to implement the snowflake. We thought this would be a good idea because it would be more efficient, and we would be able to render higher orders of the snowflake. 

However, this was a a bad decision becuause the with code became overly complicated for such simple program. In addition to the complexity of the code we also had many issues with installing packeges and libraries which slowed down the development process. 

overall, the drawbacks of using a fast language were greater than the performance gained. In this scenerio for such a sipmle program it would be better to use a language that is easy to write and maintain - like python. Perhaps to create a more complicated and sophisticated fractal renderer with 3d capabilities it would make sense to use something like opengl. 


Some people used open gl because fast

We thought it would be good because higher orders

Bad idea because complex code and issues installing packages

Not worth using a fast but complex language for such a simple program

Better to use simple program like python that is easy to write, readable and easy to debug and maintain

Could be worth for more complex fractal thing
