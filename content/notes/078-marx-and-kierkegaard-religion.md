# Kierkegaard
disagreed with marx. said progress is a conglomeration of individuals.

thought it was likely that a world would emerge where people were no longer individuals. he thought there would more people living vicariously through others, than there were individuals. 

colloseum example

two pitfalls that make you less of an idividual
- lost in infinite
	- "anxiety is the diziness of freedom" 
	- "analysis paralysis"
	- need to take action
	- not using the ability to freely act - losing a part of your individuality
- lost in finite
	- "mindlessly following cultural and social conventions"
	- usually unaware of their state
	- e.g., cows think they are freely acting, but they are actually folliwing the herd

can be in both states

The only way to stop thinking of the endless sea of possibilities is to "make a leap of faith". you can become an individual. "leap of faith" towards christianity.

was disgusted by the religion of his time. thought everyone was doing it wrong. 

"Christendom is pampered with the nonsense that the Christian God is a decent and harmless chap a good fellow and especially a friend of female business and the beginning of children. All human effort tends towards hurting each other let us unite, etc. Naturally, this happens under all sorts of high sounding names, love and sympathy and enthusiasm  the carrying out of some grand plan and the like. This is the usual hypocrisy of the scoundrels we are, but the truth is that in a herd, we are free from the standard of the individual, so millions of men live and die, they're just numbers and the Numerical becomes the horizon, that is to say, they are just copies, and Christianity which, in the divine love wants every one to be an individual, has been transferred by human bungling into precisely the opposite"

the bible is a system for bringing about the highest form of us as an individual.

the function of religion is to organise a commitment to a particular way of life. create own religion experiment

creates a "cheatsheet" for life.

avoid being lost is infinite or finite. so faith is the ultimate act of reason
