Proximity Sensors & Near Field Communication 
- Different technologies for sensing proximity or exchanging data (often dual purpose) 
- Stand-alone infrastructure approaches 
- Not widely accepted due to special hardware requirements infrastructure costs (for tracking) 
- Conceptually often similar to cell-based approaches but require extra infrastructure NFC (Example: PayWave) Bluetooth RFID IrDa 3 

Proximity Sensors & Near Field Communication

- iBeacon (Apple) 
- Broadcasts a UUID 
- ID is used with database integrated in the app

Proximity Sensors & Near Field Communication 
- RFID: Radio-frequency identification 
- Uses radio-frequency waves to transfer data between a reader and a movable item 
- Identify, 
- Categorize, 
- Track, 
- Tag objects of interests 
- No physical sight or contact needed RFID Tag 

Proximity Sensors & Near Field Communication 7 
- RFID: Radio-frequency identification 
- Basic Types: 
- Active 
- Tag transmits radio signal 
- Battery powered memory, radio & circuitry 
- High Read Range (300 feet) 
- Passive 
- Tag reflects radio signal from reader 
- Reader powered 
- Shorter Read Range (4 inches - 15 feet) 
- Tags can be read-only or read-write RFID Tag Active RFID Tags 

Proximity Sensors & Near Field Communication 8 RFID Tag 
- Host Manages Reader(s) and Issues Commands 
- Reader and tag communicate via RF signal 
	- Carrier signal generated by the reader 
	- Carrier signal sent out through the antennas 
	- Carrier signal hits tag(s) 
	- Tag receives and modifies carrier signal 
	- Antennas receive the modulated signal and send signal to the Reader 
	- Reader decodes the data Different RFID Tags Hitachi "powder" type RFID chip measuring 0.05 x 0.05 mm 

> [!INFO] can get implants of RFID
> usually connected to a database which identifies stuff. e.g., this tag is this cow
> small rfids you need to be very close as the signal is not very strong

Proximity Sensors & Near Field Communication 11 
- Near Field Communication (NFC) 
	- Subgroup of RFID techniques (13.56 MHz) 
	- Operating distance typical up to 10 cm (but up to 1m) 
	- Data exchange rate today up to 424 kilobits/s 
	- Usually used for Smartcards, digital payment, or device to device communication/ authentification NFC smartcards 

> [!INFO] small transmitters can be read with a large reader
> nfc is one specific spectrum of rfid

> [!INFO] phones are a reader. but they can also emulate a tag

Proximity Sensors & Near Field Communication 13 
- Each full NFC device can work in three modes: 
- NFC card emulation 
	- NFC-enabled devices act like smart cards, allowing users to perform transactions such as payment or ticketing. 
- NFC reader/writer 
	- NFC-enabled devices to read information stored on inexpensive NFC tags embedded in labels or smart posters. 
- NFC peer-to-peer 
	- Enables two NFC-enabled devices to communicate with each other to exchange information in an adhoc fashion. 14

GPS - Overview 
- (Navstar-) GPS is a satellite-based navigation system that provides users with Positioning (and Timing services 
	- Provides information anywhere on Earth with unobstructed Line Of Sight 
	- Operates in any weather conditions (but with accuracy constraints) 
	- Available to military, commercial and civil users 
- Similar systems: 
	- Glonass (Russia, Operational) 
	- Beidou/Compass/Beidu 2 (China, operational since 2020) 
	- Galileo (Europe, expected operational since 2020) 
	- Local coverage (DORIS, IRNSS, ..) 

> [!INFO] initally only for millitary. now open to anyone but need under open sky

GPS - Applications 
- Numerous GPS applications & GPS Receivers: 
	- Military 
		- initally for remote guided bombs
	- Car navigation 
	- Marine 
	- Flight control 
	- Agriculture 
	- Recreation 
- For mobile devices 
	- Car an personal navigation 
	- Location-based services 
	- Augmented Reality 

GPS - History 
- GPS project was developed in 1973 by U.S. Department of Defence (successor of Transit/NAVSAT 
- Originally comprised of 24 satellites, now 30 (including redundant satellites), 65 launched 
- Originally intended for military applications 
- U.S government to open GPS to civilian use in 1983 (after a Soviet jet accidentally shot a civil Korean airplane, due to navigation errors) 
- Civil based GPS was limited through Selective Availability (SA) 
- Accuracy errors of 100m 
- SA was removed for civilian users in 2003. 
- GPS achieved initial operational capability (24 Satellites) in 1993 GPS – Satellites

GPS – Satellites
- Constellation of 24 + X satellites transmitting radio signals to users 
- Altitude of 20,000km (approx.) 
- Each satellite orbits Earth twice/day 
- Arranged in 6 orbital planes 
- Each plane has four slots 
- At least four satellites from virtually anywhere on earth (we come back to this..) 
- Satellites use high precision atomic clock 

> [!INFO] constantly transmitting signal. they send the route they are flying, and where the other satelittes are flying

GPS - Signal 
- GPS satellite constantly transmits radio signals (L1 signal for privat, L2 military 
- The navigation message is made up of three major components: 
	- GPS date and time, plus the satellite's status and an indication of its health 
	- Orbital information called ephemeris data and allows the receiver to calculate the position of the satellite (valid ~4h) 
	- Almanac, contains information and status concerning all the satellites; their locations and PRN numbers needed to find satellites (valid ~180days) 
- Each satellite has a unique ID called “Gold codes” or PRNs (pseudo-random noise sequences) to differentiate each satellite 

> [!INFO] get data from four satellites, (position, time, etc). 

GPS - Receiver 
- Uses messages received from satellites (n≥4) to determine the satellite positions and time sent 
- Gives roughly distance to satellite 
- Applies Trilateration for computing location

- Gives roughly distance to satellite 
- Applies Trilateration for computing location Triangulation = working with angles Trilateration = working with distances 

GPS - Receiver 
- Uses messages received from satellites (n"4) to determine the satellite positions and time sent 
- Gives roughly distance to satellite

- Applies Trilateration for computing location In 3D (4 Spheres) 
- But our receiver does not have an atomic clock!!
