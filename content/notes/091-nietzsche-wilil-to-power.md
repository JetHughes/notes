Why do we do things: usually to be happy. some might say — no i life my life to serve i sacrifice i volunteer etc — but this still on some level, brings them happiness. 

But then why do people to so many things that make them unhappy (e.g., jealousy, guilt). Some people say (in a very shopenhauer approach to things) that these things happen because of survival, the will to life. 

but then if the goal was survival, why do people go skydiving etc. Its more complex than just survival

Nietzsche says its not will to happiness, its not will to survival, its will to power. by power he means becoming who you are, finding yourself, self expression. 

We are a part of the animal kingdom, we are part of an ecosystem. other animals e.g., bears have a will to power, to imporve their curcumstances. We are the same, but we have big brains so their are more ways to achieve this. 

some people say this notion of a will to power, extends to the entire universe. it it possible that by looking at our own existense we can learn about stars, planets etc. 

the will to power could be anything: large business, my tiny cabin in the woods by a surf spot. It's whatever you want. 


There are things we must overcome find get this "power". Humans have many differnt ideas conditioned into us that we need to overcome before we become our true self




since we exist in this world as individual agents exerting our will power, everything else is the same. all the different wills to power often condtradict each other. we dont have control over the universe, about who hits my car, etc. we have no ultimate control over the world. this is usually solves by focusing on controlling the internal world: buddism, stoicism, etc. "pain is certain, suffering is optional". however this diminishes value of good things. 

Nietzsche says that earthly attachment is necessary and, the solution is to try as hard as we can to control as much as possible.

the reason most people dont do anything extraordianry is becaue of fear or laziness. 

the worst thing is a fear of failure. we should take calculated risks. embrace the danger, embrace pain. most people run from pain and try to minimiise is. pain serves a purpose to us. its the only way we grow as people. 

the only way to experience the most intense highes is to experience the most intense pain. its only people with courage who will summit the mountain. 

its easy to manufacture the most comfortable life. 

thought experiment: what if you had to repeat your life over and over again, without changing anything, how pecious does each decision become then?
