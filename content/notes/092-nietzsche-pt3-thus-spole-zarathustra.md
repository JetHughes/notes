In this episode nietzsche talks about the  "overman". How there are three stages of life
- the camel where we carry other people burdens and dont question why
- the lion where we rebel and stop doing things for other people, questioning why
- the child where we realise we dont have to reject everything, and we become like "a child at play"

then after these three there is the overman which is like an infinitely perfect person.
