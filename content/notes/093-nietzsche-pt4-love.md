This episode is about love. We talked about the idea of love from platos symposium

he says love is like a ladder with 6 steps
- love for a particular body
- love for all bodies
- love for souls
- love for laws and institutions (Love for the practice, custom or foundation that are derived from people with beautiful souls.)
- love for knowledge
- love for beauty itself

is is commonly thought that when you find love for a higher rung, you no longer have love for the lower rungs. for example, once a person finds love of the soul, he might think that love of the body is merely lust.

However, some people think the opposite. When you climb the ladder, you better understand the previous rungs
