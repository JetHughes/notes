This question is becoming more and more popular. 

breif note about descartes "cogito ergo sum". I think before I am. He systematically doubted everything and realised that the only thing he couldn't doubt was that since he was able to doubt, and he was thinking, he must exist. From this base be built up a sort of proof that the world is real. But it wasn't very good and he made many assuptions along the way.

Drake equation: calculated the probability of other life based on number of planets, galaxies etc. Gave rise to the fermi paradox: why are there no aliens.

2005 paper about are we living in a simulation presented three options:
1. we go extinct before we are able to create the technology
2. we reach the point where we can but for some ethical or otherwise reason we dont want to 
3. we do develop the technology and we do create simulations. In which case since there is only one base reality and many simulated ones, we are most likely living in a simulation.
