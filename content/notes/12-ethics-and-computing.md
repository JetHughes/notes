# what is ethics
![example definitions|400](https://i.imgur.com/5A6nmkB.png)

- concerned with the fundamental issues of practical decision making. what actions should we take or not take?

requirements for an ethical system
- must be usable and practical
- need to be able to learn it, and use it

need to maintain respect for others views

# normative ethics
- the study of ethical behaviour
- investigates questions regarding how someone should act

three approaches
- deontology (duty or rule based)
- utilitarianism (consequentialism)
- virtue ethics (character based)

## deontology
- categorical imperitive - instrinsically valid principles that are good in and of themselves
	- must be obeyed always
	- e.g., dont murder people
- immanuel kant
- fundamental assumption that each person has intrinsic worth and deserves basic respect
- may be disagreements about principles involved - e.g., inherent universal ethics, religious laws, or cultural values

## utilitarianism
- maximise happiness and wellbeing for people
- john stuart mill
- practical approach, does not consider the rights of those who disagree, minorities, or the powerless

- identify various courses of action, ask who will be affeced by each acction, and what benefits or harms with be derived from each
- the ethical action is the one that provides the greatest good for the greatest number

- best for everyone overall

## virtue ethics
- focues on character of individuals and developing qualities of virtue or excellence.
- being a moral person rather than rule or action oriented
- aristotle
- eudaimonia - state of happiness, blessedness, or well-being
- golden rule - treat other the way you want to be treated
- golden mean - balance between extremes
	- e.g., courage - cowardice - recklessness

## problems with ethical theories
- virtue
	- depend on community having similar beliefs, values and close relationsihps
- deontology
	- how to decide on common rules when different groups have opposing views
	- what is a "right" choice results in bad consequences
- utilitatianism
	- harming a minority and benefiting a majority doesn't build mutually beneficial relationships.
	- can legitimise doing wrong by claiming that it is justified by the outcome
	- how do you know the outcome of thier choices
	- bad results can be explained away

## bad examples
