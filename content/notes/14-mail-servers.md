Email Protocols 
- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) 
	- Email delivery protocol between two MTAs 
	- Used twice: between the sender and the sender’s mail server and between the two mail servers 
- Mail fetching protocols 
	- Between the receiver and its mail server 
	- Post Office Protocol (POP): simple but limited in functionality 
	- Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP): more features, more powerful and more complex. 
		- Can check the e-mail header prior to downloading 
		- Can search the contents for a specific string prior to downloading 
		- Can partially download email

> [!INFO] STMP sender - server, server to server
> POP simple and limited, STMP more features + more config required
