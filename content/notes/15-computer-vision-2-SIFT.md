Scale Invariant Features Transform (SIFT)

Natural Feature Based Tracking (NFT)
- Extend the idea of marker to generic objects and environments 
- Requires knowledge about the environmeht (e.g. image) 
- We cannot assume to have rectangles in the environment (as with markers) 
- Need some form of other visual features (here usually corners)

SIFT
- General aim: 
	- Being able to run PnP 
	- Being able to match points (features) from the real world within points (features) camera image 
	- Give comprehensive description of image
- SIFT: Scale Invariant Feature Transform 
	- Specific implementation of 
		- Feature detection (corners) 
		- Feature description 
		- Feature matching

SIFT
- Robustness: Invariance to changes in illumination, scale, rotation, affine, perspective. 
- Locality: robustness to occlusion and clutter. 
- Distinctiveness: Easy to match to a large database of objects (e.g. different images). 
- Quantity: Many features (points) can be generated for even small objects. 
- Efficiency: Computationally “cheap”, real-time performance.

SIFT - Feature detection (corners)
- Find features (points, here corners) that give us information about the objects in the image 
- What charactserises edges and corners? 
- How to be invariant to scale? 
	- Use a scalespace for handling image structures at different scales 
	- Corners as representation of extrema points -> Difference of Gaussians (DoG)
