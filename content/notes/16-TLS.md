How to secure web applications? 
- Digital Certificate 
- Transport Layer Security (TLS) or SSL 
- HTTPS

> [!INFO] HTTPS alone is not enough to secure web traffic. we need to use TLS to secure it. 

HTTP Basic Authentication (1) 
- The simplest method for enforcing access control to web resources using a username and password. 
- Uses static standard HTTP headers with no handshake 
- Server side: uses a WWW-authenticate HTTP header 
	- WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=”Wally World” 
- Client side: uses an Authorization header 
	- Authorization: base64(username + “:” + password)

> [!INFO] base64 is not secure. It is very easy to reverse. only slightly better than cleartext

HTTP Basic Authentication (2)
- challenge-response paradigm
- The basic mechanism does not provide enough confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials.

Message Digest 
- Verifies that a message has not be altered 
- Uses a hash function 
	- MD5 
	- SHA-1
![sending a digitally signed message|300](https://i.imgur.com/lJCTjPP.png)

> [!INFO] message converted to hashed message digest, encrypted/signed using private key

HTTP Digest Authentication (1) 
- Avoids the most serious flaws of basic authentication, but not intents to be a complete solution to web security. 
	- Sever challenges using a nonce value 
	- Client responses with a digest (by default, the MD5 checksum) of the username, password, nonce value, HTTP method, and the requested URI
	- ![digest|200](https://i.imgur.com/Mg6smkw.png)
- Vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack No server authentication

> [!INFO] Encryption algorithm for digest is not reversible. 
> including the digestURI in the HA2 makes dictionary attack more difficult by increasing the complexity

SSL and TLS 
- SSL - Secure Sockets Layer protocol 
- TLS - Transport Layer Security protocol
![TCP/IP layers with ssl and tls|200](https://i.imgur.com/OuRiq1Q.png)

> [!INFO] TLS more generic. SSL more focused on terminal applications
- TLS better than SSH
- VPN is also similar (secure channel). also similar to SSH
- SSL predates TLS, they are the same thing

SSL and TLS 
SSL/TSL provides three essential services: 
- Encryption: ensure only authorized access 
- Authentication: verify the provided identification 
- Data Integrity: detect message tampering and forging 
	- Message digest

How to get the public key? 
- Through certificate issued by Certificate Authority

Digital Certificate (1) 
- What is digital certificate? 
	- Used to guarantee one is talking to the partner with whom one want to talk. 
	- Generated, signed, and managed by the certificate authorities (CA)

Digital Certificate (2) 
- Certificate Authority (CA) 
	- Generate a certificate for Bob with its private key 
	- Step 2 is usually not necessary as the public key of the CA is stored locally by the browser as trusted CA

Digital Certificate (3) 
- Can you trust a certificate? 
	- Check if the web address matches the address on the certificate 
	- Check if the certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority, and the date is valid 
	- Check the key length, the extensions, the encryption algorithms

> [!INFO] brower automatically uses certificate authority public key to verify websites

SSL & TLS History 
- SSL v2.0 by Netscape (disable this!) 
- SSL v3.0 more scrutiny, fixes attack vectors 
- TLS v1.0 (= SSL v3.1) by IETF 
	- Few changes, but incompatible with v3.0 
- TLS v1.1 clarifies, adds recommendations 
- TLS v1.2 cipher updates, extensions 
- TLS v1.3 released in 2018

SSL/TLS Protocols
- Application Layer
	- handshake protocol, changecipherspec protocol, alert protocol
- record protocol
- transport layer
![SSL/TLS Protocols|300](https://i.imgur.com/DufvW2C.png)

> [!INFO] not always iimplemented in the kernel. also implemented outside the kernel as part of the application

The Handshake Protocol 
- Uses messages to 
	- Negotiate the cipher suite 
	- Authenticate sever and/or client 
	- Exchange information for building cryptographic secrets
- https://tls.ulfheim.net/
![exchange process|300](https://i.imgur.com/DVuemNf.png)

A Closer Look at Handshake 
- The client sends a "Client hello" message to the server, along with the client's random value and supported cipher suites. 
- The server responds by sending a "Server hello" message to the client, along with the server's random value. 
- The server sends its certificate to the client for authentication and may request a certificate from the client. The server sends the "Server hello done" message. 
- If the server has requested a certificate from the client, the client sends it. 
- The client creates a random Pre-Master Secret and encrypts it with the public key from the server's certificate, sending the encrypted Pre-Master Secret to the server. 
- The server receives the Pre-Master Secret. The server and client each generate the Master Secret and session keys based on the Pre-Master Secret and the random numbers. 
- The client sends "Change cipher spec" notification to server to indicate that the client will start using the new session keys for hashing and encrypting messages. Client also sends "Client finished" message. 
- Server receives "Change cipher spec" and switches its record layer security state to symmetric encryption using the session keys. Server sends "Server finished" message to the client. 
- Client and server can now exchange application data over the secured channel they have established. All messages sent from client to server and from server to client are encrypted using a session key.

ChangeCipherSpec & Alert Protocols 
- When can the two parties use these parameters or secrets? 
	- Cannot use them until they have sent or received a special message -> the ChangeCipherSpec message 
- How to deal with errors? 
	- Uses the Alert protocol to report errors and abnormal conditions.

The Record Protocol 
- Carries messages from the upper layers 
- Message fragmentation 
- Message compression (optional) 
- Message encryption

Examples to use SSL/TLS 
- openssl s_client –starttls smtp –connect smtp.gmail.com:587 –crlf 
- openssl s_client –connect smtp.gmail.com:465 –crlf 
- See more details of STARTTLS at https://www.fastmail.com/help/technical/ssltlsstarttls.html

HTTPS 
- HTTP over TLS or HTTP over SSL 
	- Layering HTTP on top of the SSL or TLS 
	- Adding security capabilities of SSL/TLS to standard HTTP 
- Difference from HTTP 
	- HTTP URLs begin with “http://” and use port 80 by default 
	- HTTPS URLs begin with “https://” and use port 443 by default
