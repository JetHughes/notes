REAL-TIME GRAPHICS 

Based on rasterisation of graphic primitives: 
- Points 
- Lines 
- Triangles 
- Implemented in hardware (GPU)

- Rasterisation 
	- 	Computing for each triangle which pixel it covers 
	- 	Triangle centric approach 
	- 	Rasteriser only needs one triangle at a time

> [!INFO] for each pixel it computes which triangle is there. (keep triangle closest to camera)(closest hit)
