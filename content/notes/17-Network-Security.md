Security of Networks 
- Security is something that is not necessary in a trusted world!

Security 
- A system can be compromised by 
	- Malicious attacks 
	- Accidental erasure of data 
	- Disk crashes 
	- User ignorance 
- Physical security 
	- Locked in a secret cabinet 
- Trust relationships 
	- Trust relationships have be clear before making security policies. 
- Security policy 
	- Define how secure we want to be, what threats we care about, what controls we implement 
	- Balance between risk, convenience and cost

> [!INFO] always need to have backups. this is easy now because of cloud storage. but also need to be careful of privay and encryption when using cloud services. 

> [!INFO] policy
> purpose is to protect your safety. potential risk vs convenience vs cost. 

Network Security 
- Secures the network, as well as protecting and overseeing operations being done. 
	- Confidentiality: only sender, intended receiver should “understand” message contents 
	- Authentication: sender, receiver want to confirm identity of each other 
	- Message Integrity: sender, receiver want to ensure message not altered (in transit, or afterwards) without detection 
	- Access and Availability: which service or device should be accessible to which user, secure access to data

Confidentiality 
- Friends and enemies: Alice, Bob, and Trudy 
	- Bob, Alice (lovers) want to communicate “securely” 
	- Trudy (intruder) may intercept, delete, and add messages
![|300](https://i.imgur.com/oR9utF9.png)

What can Trudy do? 
- A lot 
	- eavesdrop: intercept messages 
	- actively insert messages into connection 
	- impersonation: can fake (spoof) source address in packet (or any field in packet) 
	- hijacking: “take over” ongoing connection by removing sender or receiver, inserting himself in place 
	- denial of service: prevent service from being used by others (e.g., by overloading resources) 
	- …

Principle of Cryptography
- symmetric key crypto: identical sender and receiver keys 
- public-key crypto: encryption key public, decryption key private

Authentication Protocols (1) 
- Scenario 
	- Alice, the sender, wants to communicate with Bob, the receiver 
	- Bob wants Alice to “ prove ” her identity to him 
	- Trudy tries to pretend to be Alice 
- AP1.0 
	- Alice sends a message to Bob saying she is Alice

Authentication Protocols (2) 
- AP2.0 
	- Use the source IP address to authenticate 
	- Fails if IP spoofing is used
![|300](https://i.imgur.com/lMGL0vB.png)

Authentication Protocols (2) 
- AP3.0 
	- Use secret password 
	- Password can be eavesdropped 
	- Encrypted password can be played back
![|300](https://i.imgur.com/cX9Ntp4.png)

> [!INFO] password never changes.

Authentication Protocols (3) 
- AP4.0 
	- Use a number, called a nonce, that will be used only once in a lifetime 
	- The protocol has the following procedures 
- Alice sends “I am Alice”, to Bob 
- Bob sends a nonce, R, to Alice 
- Alice encrypts the nonce using Alice and Bob’s symmetric secret key, KA-B, and sends it back to Bob 
- Bob decrypts the received message. If the decrypted nonce equals the nonce he sent Alice, then Alice is authenticated. 
	- Key distribution can be a logistic problem.

> [!INFO] prevent playback attack because "password" changes.

Key Distribution 
- Key Distribution Centre (KDC) 
	- Everyone has his/her individual key manually installed at KDC (a server) when he/she registers
![|300](https://i.imgur.com/bxdl75G.png)

Key Distribution 
	- Using KA-KDC to encrypt her communication with the KDC, Alice sends a message to the KDC saying she (A) wants to communicate with Bob(B). The message is denoted as KA-KDC (A,B) 
	- The KDC, knowing KA-KDC , decrypts KA-KDC (A,B). The KDC then generates a random number, R1. This is the shared key value that Alice and Bob will use to perform symmetric encryption when they communicate with each other. R1 is the one-time session key. In addition KDC will send Alice a pair of values A and R1 encrypted by the KDC using Bob’s key KB-KDC 
	- When Alice receives the message from the KDC, extracts R1 from the message and save it, then forwards KB-KDC (A, R1) to Bob 
	- Bob decrypts the message and knows the shared key with Alice. He takes care to authenticate Alice using R1 before proceeding further

Authentication Protocols (3) 
- AP5.0 
	- Use the public key encryption in AP4.0 
	- The protocol has the following procedures 
- Alice sends “I am Alice”, to Bob 
- Bob sends a nonce, R, to Alice 
- Alice encrypts the nonce using Alice’s private key A and sends the encrypted nonce back to Bob 
- Bob decrypts the received message using Alice public key. If the decrypted nonce equals the nonce he sent Alice, then Alice is authenticated. 
	- The retrieval of the public key could be a security hole

Access & Availability (1) 
- Securing physical access to the network 
	- Physical security to servers 
	- Physical security to networking devices 
- A common guideline If there is physical access to the equipment, there is no security!

Access & Availability (2) 
- Securing access to data 
	- Authentication and authorization: who is permitted to access which network resources 
	- Encryption/decryption: data unusable to anyone except the authorized users 
	- Virtual private networks (VPNs): allow authorized remote access to a private network via the public Internet 
	- Firewalls: protect a computer from unauthorized access and attacks 
	- Virus and worm protection: secure data from software designed to destroy data or slow down the computer 
	- Spyware protection: securing from downloading and running programs that gather personal information 
	- Wireless security

Packet sniffing: 
	- broadcast media 
	- promiscuous NIC reads all packets passing by 
	- can read all unencrypted data (e.g. passwords) 
	- e.g.: C sniffs B’s packets Countermeasures: 
	- all hosts in organization run software that checks periodically if host interface in promiscuous mode.

IP Spoofing: 
	- can generate “ raw ” IP packets directly from application, putting any value into IP source address field 
	- receiver can’t tell if source is spoofed Countermeasures: 
	- routers shouldn’t forward outgoing packets with invalid source addresses (e.g., source address not in router’s network) 
	- but ingress filtering can not be mandated for all networks
![|300](https://i.imgur.com/0rRDmaF.png)

Denial of service (DOS): 
	- flood of maliciously generated packets to swamp a receiver 
	- Distributed DOS (DDOS): multiple coordinated sources swamp a receiver 
	- e.g., C and remote host SYN-attack A Countermeasures: 
	- filter out flooded packets (e.g., SYN) before reaching host 
	- traceback to source of floods

> [!INFO] send syn, but change ip before recieving syn ack. this means

Security Policy 
- Security policy 
	- A formal statement of the rules by which people who are given access to an organisation’s technology and information assets must abide 
	- RFC 2196: Site Security Handbook. It is a guide to developing security policies for sites that are connected to the Internet 
- Purposes of security policies 
	- Policy is the first layer of protection for your resources and information 
	- To inform users, staff and managers of their obligations for protecting technology and information assets 
- Should specify the mechanism through which these requirements can be met

Security Policy 
- Policies have to be written explicitly 
	- Implied policies do not help 
- Who should be involved in writing of a policy? 
	- Site security manager 
	- IT technical staff 
	- User representatives 
	- Security incident response team 
	- Responsible management 
	- Legal counsel

Security Policy 
- Aspects of a security policy 
	- From outside the organisation 
	- From inside the organisation 
	- Against the interruption of services 
	- From user error 
	- User convenience 
	- What resources are we trying to protect? 
	- Whom are we trying to protect the resources from? 
	- What will happen if the system is compromised? 
	- How much work will we need to put into protecting the system? What risk is acceptable? 
	- Protect from loss: backup should be stored at a different physical location to the original.

Security Policy 
- Criteria for a good policy 
	- Viable implementation through system administration procedures, 
	- Acceptable by the users 
	- Can be forced with security tools and sanctions 
	- Clearly defines the areas of responsibility for the users, administrators and management
