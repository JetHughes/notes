# Notes

Economicly driven religion

Life is an immense accumulation of spectacles

Modern conditions of production - not comparable to Marx era capitalism

Marx religion between consumers and capitalism

Fetishism - confer supernatural qualities on to things

Commodity fetishism

Commodity - recent invention

We're alienated from the creative process
- E.g. production of breakfast

Argued both ways. Efficiency vs alienation

E.g., meat industry. Hunting vs supermarket meat

Passively participantin horrible means of production

Value of an item is determined by its social standing not material value

Commodities become symbolic representations of social agreements

Not how we experience them though

We don't see the complex social agreements or the manufacturing. We see the item.
- Commodity fetishism
- We think the are special not that they just appear special

Or relationship with commodities was a prophecy for what all things would become

> In a [dérive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive "Dérive") one or more persons during a certain period drop their usual motives for movement and action, their relations, their work and leisure activities, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there... But the dérive includes both this letting go and its necessary contradiction: the domination of psychogeographical variations by the knowledge and calculation of their possibilities.

> the core Lettrist concept that every major arena of human interaction, whether it be [literary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary "Literary") or [economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic "Economic"), follows the same basic pattern. A paradigm is introduced into a system and iterated upon until all possibilities are exhausted (this is deemed the [amplic phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettrism#Key_concepts "Lettrism")), at which point the only path forward is to deconstruct the system down to its most granular elements (the [chiseling phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettrism#Key_concepts "Lettrism")). Once the system has been fully deconstructed, the pieces are set into a new paradigm and the cycle begins again.
