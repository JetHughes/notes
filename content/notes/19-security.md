- why cybersecurity is a growing concern
	- more software ∴ more dependecies ∴ more complex ∴ more "surface area" of risk of vulnerability
- sketch confidentiality, integrity, and avalability security
	- confidentiality - protecting data from being stolen
	- integrity - attacks on data with the aim to decieve users
	- avalability - e.g., DDoS
- appreciate that dependencies cause security risks
	- vulnerabilities in dependencies extend to your code
- explain risks from non-validation of user input
	- 
- outline how injection attack works
	- malicious input to manupulate underlying database
