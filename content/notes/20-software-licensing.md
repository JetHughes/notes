what does it mean for people to use your software. What responsitilities do you have

- Understand the default protection of code 
	- authors copyright
- Contrast ‘libre’ free and ‘gratis’ free 
	- libre: free as in freedom
	- gratis: free as in no cost
- Define what makes open source software 
	- floss - free libre open source software
- Contrast copyleft and more permissive licences 
	- copyleft  "viral licensing"
		- usage of copyleft software required your software be copyleft also
		- derivative must "copy" the same license
	- others e.g., creative commons
		- allow a selection of *facets* [Creative commons](notes/software-licensing.md#Creative%20commons)
- Appreciate that code can be multi-licensed 
	- e.g., floss for non-commercial use but commercially licenced otherwise
- Understand how to apply a license to code 
	- project should include complete license text: LICENSE file in top-level of project directory
	- also good idea to add to each file
- Appreciate licenses can be mutually incompatible
	- e.g., developing software that combines two FLOSS code bases that have different code licenses.
	- could be impossible to satisfy both licenses simultaneously.
