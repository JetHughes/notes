# Tangible Computing

![Toni Box (Figures courtesy of iFixit)|300](https://i.imgur.com/cL8Dss1.png)
> [!INFO] Tangible interactive music pllayer
> like marble phone machine with the marbles which represents voicemail
> need to be able to detect slaps and identiufy the figure on top
> accelerometer for slaps, NFC for little person with a magnet to hold them on
> very cheap to make


![Tangible Character Articulation|300](https://i.imgur.com/R8lDtGp.png)
> [!INFO] tanglible interface for animators
> e.g., work at weta. hard job to do animations. normally drag bones using mouse. 
> instead use a physical 3d model to match the figure to animate.
> interact with a 3d skeleton of the figure. 
>physical device is modular. had joints etc

> [!INFO] tangible interface for mixed reality
> physical 3d object that emulates the shape of virtual objects in 3d space
> e.g., a robot that goes with you, and wherever you want to touch something in 3d it presents a actual object there for you

> [!INFO] movable floor
> physical representation of floor matches shape of ground in virtual reality

![Tangible Bots|300](https://i.imgur.com/9xjUP3y.png)
> [!INFO] tangible bots
> maybe 10 years away
> more general tangible bots
> bots to place on interfaces.

> [!INFO] siimilar to the 3d physical object vr thing but with drones
> > drones carrying user interface elements
> windows that fly with you

> user proxemic interactionand orientation and distance to control smart appliances

> [!INFO] use the position and orientation of people to connect devices and share information

> [!INFO] airdrop acrutall uses proximity to send via bluetooth. but not as good spatiality
