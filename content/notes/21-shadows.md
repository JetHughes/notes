SHADOWS 
- Important depth cue 
- Spatial Relationship between objects 
- Realism 
- Provides information about scene lighting

SHADOWS AS DEPTH CUE 
- Important depth cues 
- Provide information about relative locations
![](https://i.imgur.com/lDUt6Lv.png)

SHADOWS FOR REALISM 
Examples: 
- Missing Shadows 
- Wrong Shadows
![](https://i.imgur.com/rOQh14w.png)

SCENE LIGHTING 
- Position of light sources 
- Types of lights: 
	- Hard shadows vs. soft shadows 
	- Point lights have hard edges 
	- Area lights have soft edges 
- Coloured light sources

WHAT ARE SHADOWS? 
- Shadows are areas hidden from a light source 
- Surface is only illuminated if nothing blocks its view of the light

TERMINOLOGY
![TERMINOLOGY](https://i.imgur.com/53biIuI.png)

PROJECTIVE SHADOWS
- Easy to compute 
- Simply project geometry on ground plane 
- Only works on flat shadow receivers, e.g. car on street, player on ground 
- No self-shadows 
- Expensive: needs to be rendered every frame even for static scenes

SHADOW/VIEW DUALITY
- A point is in shadow if it not visible from the perspective of the light source 
- Use the view from the light source to compute shadows
![](https://i.imgur.com/55TRlPL.png)

> [!INFO] every ray from the light will hit the scene. if a point is in shadow it is not visivble from the light source

SHADOW MAPPING 
- Use shadow/view duality 
- Two rendering passes 
	- 1st Pass: Rendering shadow map representing the depth from light source 
	- 2nd Pass: Render final image from camera view and check shadow map to see if points are in shadow

SIDE NOTE: RENDER-TO-TEXTURE 
- Render scene into a texture 
- Can be used for post render effects (lab) 
- Can be used for shadow mapping
![](https://i.imgur.com/V2YlA8c.png)

FIRST PASS: RENDER SHADOW MAP 
Create a map of depth values as seen from the light’s point of view 
- Geometry is rendered into a depth buffer from the point of view of the light 
- Transform the geometry into light-view space

> [!INFO] same as model view projection matrix excpet projecting into the light not the camera

In practice: Vertex shader transforms the geometry into light-view space

- Render to texture: shadowMap 
- Use shadowMap as input for second rendering pass
![](https://i.imgur.com/7q3lsoz.png)

SECOND PASS: RENDER SCENE 
- Render final output from camera view and check shadow map to see if points are in shadow 
- Compare distance between point and light source and value in shadow map 
- If distance larger than value in shadow map point is in shadow
![](https://i.imgur.com/VNRwUPf.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/AzzKkuq.png)

- Transform points in light space 
- Transform points in shadow map 
- Look up value from shadow map (depthVal(p)) 
- Compute visibility based on: 
- dist(p) > depthVal(p) 
- **In practice**: use vertex shader and fragment shader
![Vertexshader:](https://i.imgur.com/opPV4F0.png)
![Fragmentshader:](https://i.imgur.com/2Bkndf6.png)

Final Shading Step 
- Use calculated visibility to compute fragment’s output colour 
- **In practice**: use visibility in fragment shader:

> [!INFO] dont cancel out ambient light

LIMITATIONS 
- Field of View 
- Surface Acne 
- Aliasing

FIELD OF VIEW PROBLEM 
- What if object is outside field of view of shadow map? 
- No shadows or partial shadows 
- For spot lights, this can be changed by tweaking its range 
- Problem in particular for larger scenes
![](https://i.imgur.com/LSmO1SZ.png)

> [!INFO] Takes a lot of tweaking (tiral and error). limitation on size of FOV

SURFACE ACNE 
- Self-shadowing problem due to precision and depth map resolution 
	- Depth value in map can differs from actual distance between object and light source 
	- Sampling problem: neighbouring vertices map to the same depth map pixel
![](https://i.imgur.com/jNlM4RR.png)

SHADOW MAP BIAS 
- Solution for surface acne: 
	- Shadow map bias for shadow test: ShadowMap(x,y) + bias < dist 
	- Choosing a good bias value can be tricky - otherwise Peter Panning

SHADOW MAP ALIASING 
- Quality depends on shadow map resolution 
- Higher resolution: 
	- Higher quality 
	- More memory required
![](https://i.imgur.com/12EXMZG.png)

MORE SOLUTIONS FOR SHADOW MAP ALIASING 
- Under-sampling of the shadow map – Jagged shadow edges 
- Solution: Percentage closer filtering (PCF)
![](https://i.imgur.com/UncfDuR.png)

PERCENTAGE CLOSER FILTERING (PCF)
- Interpolation of the results of the shadow map computation 
- Quality increases with Percentage closer filtering 
- Softer appearance of shadows
![](https://i.imgur.com/AWFhwA0.png)

PERCENTAGE CLOSER FILTERING (PCF)
- Results for different filter size
![](https://i.imgur.com/Se3tCdU.png)

PERSPECTIVE ALIASING 
- View space resolution vs. shadow map resolution
![](https://i.imgur.com/4ihsVhv.png)

CASCADE SHADOW MAPS 
- Providing higher resolution of the depth texture near the viewer and lower resolution far away
