# Performance requirements
- e.g., credit card system
	- functional reqs
		- sales authorised only for valid cards
		- generate monthly statements
		- performance requirements
			- cards are validated quickly
			- statements are accurate and generated on time
		- quickly, accurate, and on time need to be operationalised, measured, and tested.

Why are they important
- vital quality factor
- infosystems are wide and varied
- wide range of performance characteristics

Things to consider
- can interact and conflict with each other
	- accuracy vs speed
	- speed vs space
	- often a trade-off or compromise
- selectig best developent techniques for taget system
	- algorithms
	- data structures
	- languages and frameworkds
	- constraints of target platform 
		- (devs machines are often more powerful)
		- minimum requiremnts for system e.g., min specs for windows
	- ...

- impact of changing requirements, e.g., adding a new module
- need to consider (often conflicting) organisational priorities
- critical to unambiguously document and agree

# Response time
- what is quick
- for most people
	- < 0.1s: instant
	- 0.1s to 1s: noticable
	- 1s to 10s: slow
	- > 10s: user will probably switch tasks
- affected by system workload: number of concurrent users, volume of data, etc vs available resources
- most users really dislike variable response times (unpredicatbility)


- example requiremen: "cards are validated within 2s"
	- this implies 100%
	- better: "95% of cards are validated within 2 s"
- other consideration
	- what is included in response time?
	- what is the measurement period (of the system in general) (often varied workload changes performance)
	- what is the acceptable error rate

# Workload
- system workload is almost never constant
	- may may well defined peaks and troughs
	- may be unpreditable
	- peak vs typical vs minimum
- differet transaction types
	- read vs write transactions
	- online vs batch

- define workload requirements around use cases
- e.g., " the system must be able to validate 1 million cards per day"

# Scalability
- can the system scale to meet changing demand
- can it scale quickly enough
- elasticity particularly important to large public-facing systems
- can be difficult to test "for real"
- example requirement: "the system must be able to handle up to 2 million cards on a busy day"

# Platform
- target for system deployment
	- on prem
	- cloud
- do you have a choice
- will the platform be only just for this system or for other things (multi tenanting)
- what limits are imposed by the platform
- does it inlclude external systems or resources


# Caching
- temporarily store frequently used data
- same concept as [memoization](notes/memoization.md)
- mainly about improving read performance
	- when retrieving data, look in the cache first
	- if its there (=hit), done
	- if not (or stale) (=miss), read from original source
	- can be several orders of magnitude faster
	- ideal for small, frequently accessed data
- cache contents needs to be managed
	- e.g., least recently used (LRU) data drop out as cache fills up
	- cahced data can become inconsistent with original source
- can go anywhere
	- databse, client, dedicated caching server
	- numberourus cahcing tools, e.g., memcache, redis

# Pooling
- pre allocate a set of shared resources that are kept ready for use (e.g., databse connetions, objects)
- useful when:
	- allocating eacch resources has a significant cost (time space)
	- there are frequent requests of short duration
	- we need to limit the total number of resources
- mainly about resource management, so pools ar maintaineed by the resource allocator
- important to reset resources when returning to the pool.
	- e.g., ensure atabase connection has no incomplete statements
	- ensures state doesn't leak across different uses of same resource

# System reliability
- behaviour of system
- graceful degradation - should behave sensibly under all but the most extreme circumstances
- should't just crash
	- thorough automated testing
	- thorough user testing
- raw errors shouldn't bubble up to the user
	- user wont understand -> pointless
	- may expose sensitive information (e.g., file system paths)
	- particularly relevant for web applications
	- handle exceptions accordingly
- system should handle capacity issues as cleanly as possible
	- give relevant feedback to user (not just spinning wheel of death)
	- implement load balancing for web applications, expecially if they use a services model
	- also pooling, cachig, etc.


# Integrity and security considerations
- consider following security requirements
	- only staff with correct authority can alter data
	- secure transactions over iternet
	- https is better
	- validation of data
	- secure storage of passowrds
	- legilsations complliance
- needs to be integreated into application and database
- and considered throughout development
- least privilege
	- a user should only have access to what they absolutely need in order to perform their responsibilities, and no more.

# Integity and securuty controls
- ensure correct system function by:
	- reject invalid data inputs
	- preventing unauthorised data inputs and outputs
	- protecting data and programs against tampering
- objectives:
	- ensure only appropriate business transactions occur
	- ensure transactions are recoreded and processed correctly
	- protect and safeguard organisational assets
	- protect and safegurad customer data

increased security -> decreased accessiblility and usability

# integity and securuty mechanisms
- data integrity
	- input field validation
	- database constraints
- data security
	- databas access control
	- trasaction logging
	- redundancy, backup, recovery
	- encryption, hashing, digital signatures
	- ouput control (exfiltration prevention)
- system security
	- user authentication and authorisation
		- In authentication process, the identity of users are checked for providing the access to the system. While in authorization process, person’s or user’s authorities are checked for accessing the resources. Authentication is done before the authorization process, whereas authorization process is done after the authentication process.
		- | Authentication determines whether the person is user or not. | While it determines What permission do user have? |
		- authentication| Example : Employees in a company are required to authenticate through the network before accessing their company email.
		- authorization | Example : After an employee successfully authenticates, the system determines what information the employees are allowed to access. |

	- authentication methods
	- security patches and updates
	- preventing or mitigating known attack vectors
