notes
- started with 
	- maxDisp 16-128
	- blocksize 5-21 step by 4
- after first run things i noticed
- overall brightness decreases as maxdisparity increases
- seems to be getting closer to a good output as blocksize approaches 21
- i will try again with parameters closer to 21 maybe 13 - 31
- max disparity 32 looked best. 

- 21 is definitely best blocksize for the bell

- rock
	- 64_21 looked best.
	- repeating with higher max disparity and blocksize in range 17-25 (step 4)
	- 64_21 still the best
