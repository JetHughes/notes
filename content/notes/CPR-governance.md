from [Ostrom1990]

**1.a) User boundaries**: Clear boundaries between legitimate users and nonusers must be clearly defined.

**1.b) Resource boundaries**: Clear boundaries are present that define a resource system and separate it from the larger surrounding environment.

**2.a) Congruence with local conditions**: Appropriation and provision rules are congruent with local social and environmental conditions.

**2.b) Appropriation and provision**: The benefits obtained by users from a common-pool resource (CPR), as determined by appropriation rules, are proportional to the amount of inputs required in the form of labor, material, or money, as determined by provision rules.

**3) Collective-choice arrangements**: Most individuals affected by the operational rules can participate in modifying the operational rules.

**4.a) Monitoring users**: Monitors who are accountable to the users monitor the appropriation and provision levels of the users.

**4.b) Monitoring the resource**: Monitors who are accountable to the users monitor the condition of the resource.

**5) Graduated sanctions**: Appropriators who violate operational rules are likely to be assessed graduated sanctions (depending on the seriousness and the context of the offense) by other appropriators, by officials accountable to the appropriators, or by both.

**6) Conflict-resolution mechanisms**: Appropriators and their officials have rapid access to low-cost local arenas to resolve conflicts among appropriators or between appropriators and officials.

**7) Minimal recognition of rights to organize**: The rights of appropriators to devise their own institutions are not challenged by external governmental authorities.

**8) Nested enterprises**: When the system is very complex, appropriation, provision, monitoring, enforcement, conflict resolution, and governance activities are organized in multiple layers of nested enterprises.
