brain scan technique. It measures outer areas of brain. cant measure the deep inside of the brain 

for [[empathic-computing]] we cant measure super specific sensor data. we instead measure the frequency in different areas of the brain.


there is a theory that when people interact they get into [[brain-sync]]
