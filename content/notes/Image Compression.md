# Compression
- Used to reduce file size of images (ideally without degrading their quality)
- Eliminates redundant information
- Lossy compression is suitable for use when perfect image quality is not necessary like in web and media. 
- Lossess compression is suitable when perfect image quality is required such as medical imaging or archival purposes

# Lossless Compression
- Compression without permanently deleting data. You can perfectly reconstruct the image
- Formats
	- PNG
	- BMP

# Lossy Compression
- Achieve higher compression by discarding information that is less important for human perception
- Formats
	- JPEG
