# Summary
Proposes a system of running a _simulated_ blockchain in alongside the real one and using it to test out ideas. Uses the ACP (artificial systems, computational experiments, parallel execution) approach

DAO is a typical complex system with the characteristics of social and engineering complexity. The parallel intelligence theory based on the ACP method provides an effective solution for DAOs parallel governance. As shown in Figure 1, The parallel governance for DAOs is based on parallel DAO systems. Parallel DAO is a combination of Artificial systems, Computational experiments, and Parallel execution (ACP) approach [8]–[10] and the DAO. In a parallel DAO, the artificial systems (A) part is used to model one or more artificial DAO systems corresponding to the real-world DAO systems. Based on the co-evolving real-world and artificial blockchain systems, diversified computational experiments could be designed and conducted in the computational experiments (C) part to evaluate and verify specific behavior, mechanisms, and strategies involved in the DAO systems. The optimal solution will emerge through these experiments and feedback to the real-world DAO systems in the parallel execution (P) part to realize the decision optimization and parallel tuning the DAO systems.

# Notes
voting mechanisms
- direct
- representative
- flow
 
^ lead to whale effect (?)

- [[quadratic voting]] - aims to solve problem of voting influence
	- reduces effect of holder with large amounts of tokens
	- vulnerable to collusion and sybil attacks
