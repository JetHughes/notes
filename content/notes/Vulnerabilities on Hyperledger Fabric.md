# Summary
Identified two security vulnerabilities in hypderledger fabric, examined their effects, and proposed two solutions.

# Extracts
"First, the identity of an endorser is known to all members within a channel, which opens a gateway for [DoS attack](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/denial-of-service-attack "Learn more about DoS attack from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") on endorsers in order to either block transaction pertaining to a client, or to degrade network efficiency. Second, the technology is prone to [wormhole attack](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/wormhole-attack "Learn more about wormhole attack from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") i.e. within a channel, compromising a member leads to leakage of ledger information of all members, to everyone outside the channel."
