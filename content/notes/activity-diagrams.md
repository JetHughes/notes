- activities
	- take place over some pariod of time
	- linked by transitions (arrows)
	- only one starting point potentaily many ending conditions

- Transitions
	- have guard conditions that must be satisfied before the transition can occur

### 3.5 Decision points
- represent conditional branching
- two or more alternative transitions depending on condition
- every transiiton exiting the decision point must have a guard condition
