## Agile Manifesto
- Customer satisfaction by early and [[continuous-delivery]] of valuable software 
	- [[continuous-integration|CI]]/CD
	- success is beating your own plans
	- "valuable" software the customer wants
- Welcome changing [[requirements]], even in late development 
	- encourage change: competitive advantage
- Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months) 
	- RAD
	- prototypes to get quick feedback etc
- Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
	- customer present at daily standups maybe
- Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted 
	- people need to be happy/motivated etc
	- trust and avoid micromanagement
- Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
	- meetings should be easy
- Working software is the primary measure of progress 
	- also needs to be maintainable software 
	- not the only measure
- Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace 
	- constant pace implies lack of pressure
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design 
	- important! can be ignored due to not being measurable and can cause a build up of technical debt 
- Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential 
	- refactoring
	- build one to throw away
- Best [[software-architectures]], [[requirements]], and designs emerge from self-organizing teams 
	- 
- Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
	- business as usual includes changing business as usual
