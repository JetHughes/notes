- [x] What is Sharding?
	- breaking blockchain into smaller pieces (not sure how or how) to increase scalability
- [x] Even if a farm says they didn't use some chemical, how does the blockchain verify that. Does someone need to go and physically audit them?
	- records stored on the chain are just timestamped hashes of documents obtained via e.g., a lab who tests the soil
	- Can the group, as a DAO almost, collectively employ someone to do this?
	- I guess that still wouldn't stop the participant being audited from bribing them or something.
- [x] what actually is hyperledger fabric? Is it a closed blockchain that different groups can run independently for their own use-case? Or is it one single closed blockchain that many different groups participate in.
	- hyperledger fabric is one of the projects created by hyperledger. It is a framework/base from which the community can develop their own blockchains.
- [x] is governance within a closed blockchain the same as within an open blockchain
	- no I dont think so.[Governance of open vs closed blockchains](notes/governance.md#Governance%20of%20open%20vs%20closed%20blockchains)
- [x] does the central authority e.g., govt decide who can join and leave?
	- yes, but is this responsibility restricted only to them? Can other parties approve new participants?
- [x] What are public vs private permissioned blockchains
	- [blockchain-types](notes/blockchain-types.md)
- [x] why would a participant want to fork?
	- just having the capability is important
		- means the authority has to act in the interest of the parites otherwise they will fork
	- swtiching authorities?

Ignored questions

- [x] What do the governance rules need to accomplish?
	- Shouldn't the system just work?
	- Very broad question
	- Maybe:
		- Maintenance/Development of the codebase (PIP/EIP?)
		- Inviting/banning participants
		- Conducting phsysical audits?
	- this is something i need to figure out myself
- [x] What are they voting on?
	- Seems like a very dumb question. I guess a lot of things. But I'm not sure so I'll add it here
- [x] Who will be participating in the blockchain?
	- Three major parties in food supply-chain: Market, Manufacturing, Agriculture
	- Do I need to define this in more detail?
 - [x] Do we need to track the products physically?
	- A: not relevant yet
- [x] How is on-chain governance implemented?
	- Smart contracts? Consensus algorithms?
- [x] Why is block size significant?
	- not relevant
