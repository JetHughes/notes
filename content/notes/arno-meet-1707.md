hons What should I base my decision on
- do I want to go into research?
- what research do I want to go into?
	- 
- what projects are likely to be more successful or relevant to the field they are in
- what do i want to get out of this? what 

do you think its worth doing honours at all if I will go into industry anyway

do you think either of the projects are more likely to be relevant 

do you think either one will be more or less difficult

I'm not sure what I should be asking tobias. I also think this might help me to know what I need to find out so that I can make a better decision

if i go beyond honours into  a thesis ec.

if this could go into that
