A subset of [[extended-reality|XR]] where the virtual elements are embedded into the real environment.

Makes use of [[optical-see-through|OST]] and [[video-see-through|VST]] [[head-mounted-display|HMDs]] as well as [[spatial-augmented-reality|SPA]] to achieve this.

- embedded in real environment
- spatially aligned VR
- _impression of one single environment_

also should be interactive
