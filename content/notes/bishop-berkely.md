# Superstition
[040-superstition](notes/040-superstition.md)

Bishop Berkely wanted to abolish superstitions concerning the senses. 

There was a common idea that there is a "true reality" that is hidden behind a "veil of perception". 

Berkely questioned this idea. He said since the only thing we interact with is our "idea" of reality, and we never experience the "real" world, how do we know it exists?

His goal was to preserve the idea of god. He thought that philosophy was heading in a direction that could lead to the demise of the idea of "God".
