no just about aesthetic - also intent and morals


became popular in the 60s. mass concrete started in the 20s. cheap, interesting shapes. 

after ww2 cities were very broken. they wanted to find a way to rebuild while also creting a perception of hope and social change. put money into this new vision - entrusted architects with complete freedom to test their ideas. has a very strong idea about what a socialist society should look like.

believed they were creating spaces for the people. 

in the building the buildings they wanted to show complete honesty, and transparency - how they were built, what they were made from, and what their function were

against ornamentation - manual labor for these was hard. so they highlighted only the functional elements of the building. believed they were creating a new "democratic" building type. to achieve this, they would even detail the concrete to make it more rough.

they focesd on the public spaces with massive atriums and balconies, open stairwells, corridoes, water features, planters - didn't realise that people actually dont like hanging out in massive concrete spaces - the spaces became neglected, and abandoned and attacted unwanted activities

conrete deteriorates and weathers really bad so they started to look dirty and gross


this is what architects like about them - the heroic socialst ideals. its more interesting these days because a lot of architects build for corporate developers, and "capitalist society" - they dont tend to get that creative freedom. the second reason is the quality of the concrete - its almost a natural materist. made from local aggregates so the color and texture depends on the geology and climate of the surrounding area. every region has a different concrete. Its also hard to work with and reasy to screw up - so they think the brutalist building are impressive. 

might be becoming popular (on reddit) because the building are very photogenic. the texture, sharp geometric shapes, intense light conditions. this makes them interesting subjects.

we have started to "consume architecture" through a screen - so when we see a single shot of a building we never have to see live in or see, we can be drawn to their radical quality

so ugly they are lovable
