potential employer needs to now i

need to target toward the dev/hiring manager. built wha the need/want to see. They should be able to instantly recognise if its what they want.

doesn't matter what tools you use. Try to build a project that uses the same stack as the company you are applying for.

Should built an app not 1 hour a day. Should do in large blocks. e.g., spend one saturday.

# The Project

Should:
- follow a design pattern
	- e.g., for web apps: mvc: model view controller [MVC](model-view-controller.md)
- clean professional UI
	- mobile and desktop
	- people are "visual buyers"
	- use a bootstrap template
- database
	- must perform all of CRUD operations
- security
	- authorisation --> giving people permissions once they are logged in
	- authentication --> logging in
	- use a third party service like auth zero
- solve a business problem
	- i.e., not a toy app (tic tac toe, etc)


## Bug/Issue Tracker
- e.g., JIRA, etc
- This can be easily adjusted to fit different industries.

# Building the Project

## 1 SRS
- compile the requirements
- divide these into sprints.
	- these are the blocks discussed earlier
- blocks rabbit holes

## 2 Track your progress
- keeps details
- use the bug tracker you are building
- show this to the interviewer

# Common Mistakes

- Build using .NET, ASP.net mvc, C#. This is the most common.
- Dont start with a small program
- Show the project to people
	- Show to recruiters
	- Demo in interviews
