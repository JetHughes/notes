made up of:
- [CPU](notes/CPU.md)
- [memory](notes/memory.md)
- etc

# Von Neumann Architecture
- three key concepts
	- data and instructions are stored in a single read-write memory
	- contents of memory are addressable by location, without regard to the type of data contained
	- execution occurs in a sequential fashion, unless explicitly altered, from one instuction to the next
- programs and data are the same thing
	- and so its possible to write soure code (data) and comile them into executables (programs) that can be loaded as data and then executed as programs
