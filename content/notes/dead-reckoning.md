a method of [[sensor-fusion]] which predicts current location based on previous state

estimating current position using previously known position, and direction, and speed, and elapsed time.

**Cons**
- small errors lead to incorrect positions
- cumulative error
- periodic recalibration required

**Example**
- going through tunnel
- [[GPS]] is blocked
- predict location from speed, location, direction, time
