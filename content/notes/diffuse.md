- direct light from light sources
- light reflected equally in all directions
- darker where the surface normal is facing away from the light source. and vice versa
	- higher angle of incidence = brighter 
- independent of view angle

**components**
- diffuse light $l_d$
- diffuse material factor $k_d$
- light direction $L$
- surface normal $N$
