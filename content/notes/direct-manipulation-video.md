e.g., better measuring cup

ford qquote about faster horse

four insights
- both transit and cookware simply asking doesn't work
- find out by going into the field
- bring protoypes with you
- listen to peoples own designs

two steps each has success or failure
- action --> gulf of execution
- evaluating the outcome --> gulf of evaluation

6 questions
- determine the function
- tell what actions
- determine actual action
- perform the actions
- tell what state
- mapping from system state and interpretation

to reduce gulfs
- visibility (perciebves affordances or signifiers)
- feedback 
- consistency (standards)
- non-destructive operations (undo/redo)
- discoverability (operations discovers by exploration)
- reliability

e.g., vending machine example 


# Command line vs GUI

e.g., moving a file
gui - have continuous feedback
cmd - have to know syntax, almost no feedback

direct manipulation
- immdediate feedback
- continuous represntations of objects
- leverage metaphor (take advangates of pre-existing knowledge)

successful  indirection. cmd provides generalisation


eye to the future: gestures
- solutions to menu creep?
- even more direct?
