Defines how the length of time need to complete a task changes as the number of people working on the task increases.

For example, if a project was estimated to take 10 [[the-man-month|man-months]] and it was an indivisible task. Add more people would not change how fast the task in completed.


If it takes 1 person 9 months to hand-plough a 1000m2 field, how long would it take with 7 people?
