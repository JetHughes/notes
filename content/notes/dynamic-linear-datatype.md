Both are Dynamic linear data types (interface) 

An abstraction of a collection of data organised "in a line" which supprts addition of new elements and the removal of (some) old elements
- representation
	- array (preffered because of memory management)
	- linked list (seems more natural)
	- and others

# Stack
LIFO Last in first out

Can be used using javas `ArrayDeque` `push` and `pop` methods

# Queue
FIFO First in first out

Can be used using javas `ArrayDeque` `add` and `remove` methods

e.g., [priority-queue](notes/priority-queue.md)
