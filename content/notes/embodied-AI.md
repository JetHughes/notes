A subfield of [[artificial-intelligence|AI]] that focuses on creating [[intelligence|intelligent]] agents or systems that interact with their [[agent-environments|environment]] through physical bodies.

## Starting at the beginning 

How hard is it to build something like us? One way of measuring the difficulty of a task is to look at how long evolution took to discover a solution.

- Most of evolutionary time was spent designing robust systems for physical survival. 
- In this light, what’s ‘distinctively human’ seems relatively unimportant!

> [!INFO] playing chess etc, is the last thing that should come. we should solve all the easier problems that more simple organisms did first.
> focus on developing AI in a evolutionary sense.
> e.g., we don't have AI insects (like mars rover) ∴ we shouldn't work on chess ai yet

## An evolutionary approach to AI 
Proponents of embodied AI believe that in order to reproduce human intelligence, we need to retrace an evolutionary process: 

- We should begin by building robust systems that perform very simple tasks—but in the real world. 
- When we’ve solved this problem, we can progressively add new functionality to our systems, to allow them to perform more complex tasks. 
- At every stage, we need to have a robust, working real-world system. 

Maybe systems of this kind will provide a good framework on which to implement distinctively human capabilities. 
This line of thought is associated with a researcher called Rodney Brooks


## the importance of practical work

Roboticists stress the importance of working in the physical world. 
- It’s very hard to simulate all the relevant aspects of a robot’s physical environment. 
- The physical world is far harder to work with than we might think—there are always unexpected problems. 
 
So (though very briefly) we’re going to do some practical work with LEGO bots in Lab 1
