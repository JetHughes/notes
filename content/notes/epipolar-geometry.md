- generally [[cameras]] have different calbration, rotaion an translation.
- if we project a ray from the origin through a point in the first image. that point in the second images lies on the project of that ray onto the plane of the second image
- a line between the camera origins crosses the image plane of each camera at the **epipoles**
- a plane between the two camera origins and a point in the first camera intersects the second camera plane at the **epipolar line**
- if the images are parallel, the epipolar lies are parallel, and the poles are at infinity
