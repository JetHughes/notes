A screen placed near the users eye typically used for [[extended-reality|XR]] applications

Two main types: [[video-see-through|VST]] and [[optical-see-through|OST]]

- VST
- can easily adjust what the user sees
- is better at most things but OST "feels" better

- OST
- can't fully occlude objects
- very difficult to do spatial alignment as we need to continuously calibrate

## Issues
- need to adjust for [[inter-pupilliary-distance|IPD]]
- user sees what the camera sees â†’ can be different from the eye view
- cannot change focus distance of camera
- low res
- interpupillary difference
- colour difference
