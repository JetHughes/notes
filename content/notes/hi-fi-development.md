Firstly I converted the lo-fi prototypes into Adobe XD designs.

I decided I wanted to make some chagnes to the design here so I saved this as version 1.

## Schedule changes

I wanted to chagne the way the schedule/altude options worked. My first rough redesign was this:

I thought I could remove the separation and combine the two screens. But this didn't work so well.  However, I think the ability to switch between meters and feet was good as this improves **user control and freedom**. Also the use of the spinner for time and altitude selection will be familiar to most users. This improves use of **consistency and standards**, and **recognitiona over recall**

I then decided to try a "switch" type design, where the user is forced to chooose between the schedule and the altitude.

I think think this works much better as it **shows the system status** clearly. And has a less cluttered more **miniml, aesthetic design**. I kept the weekday selection on both screens as the might only want use the altitude system on certain days. This improves, **user control and freedom**.

I also thought it might not be super what the funcitons of the two options were, especially the altitude option. So decided to add a closable info card with some information. This improves **help and documentation**

I thought the info symbol might have looked like a button so I changed it:

I also changed the alignment of the weekday selection buttons. And the altitude selector

## Trick options Changes
I decied to change the way this worked. Instead of have the save cancel buttons I wanted the settings change to have immediate effect, so the user didn't have to save. This was the first redesign:

This is largely the same, except I added a head with back button and remove the bottom save and cancel buttons. Next I changed the dropdown for each of the trick types to individual screens with the commonly used right chevron icon.

## "Color" scheme changes

After I had mostly finished the Layout. I changed the look to match the snowboarding "aesthetic", by making the app primarily black

## More layout changes
I decided to add the home row navigation back to the trick options screens to improve **user control and freedom**
