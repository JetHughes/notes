The unique virtue of holograms is that they record and replay all the characteristics of light waves going through the recording medium. Hence there is no difference between seeing a natural object or scene, and seeing a properly illuminated hologram of it.

However, they require immense resolution (micrometer range) so it is difficult to produce them.

The two fundamental wave-optical ingredients are interference and diffraction. 

Start with examples of static hologram

Holger example: hologram of a camera of a picture...

Understand why it's cool/relevant

Difference static vs electro

Static with projection

Interactivity from non holographic content

Start with light and coherent light

How is it recorded and reconstructed (static)
 
Then electro. 

Difference "real vs fake" holograms

Prototypical systems and applications

Near eye holograpgics displays

Limitations and possibilities

Separate technical term from marketing term

Static: static holography to produce lenses
What are possibilities
