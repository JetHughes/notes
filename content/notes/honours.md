## Plan
- Try to record some data from the cameras
- Initial approach: Light field with no neural network
	- Unity route vs Non Unity route
		- Using textures (?) Jacobs way of doing it was best
		- Why use unity
		- Need to do both at some point anyway (?)
	- Live-stream vs Recorded
		- Recorded for PoC
	- Calibration
		-
