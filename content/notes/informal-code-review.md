All programmers spend time doing this.

You review your code as you write it. You refactor, refine and extend code as you write it.

[[unit-testing|unit tests]] demonstrate the expected way to use your units (classes) and others will look to your tests as best practice

checking whether code should be included in the main code

## Informal review processes
- testing (difficult to write tests for bad code)
- pair programming
	- helps to find simple improvements and reduce silly errors
- code inspections (eyeballing)
- code walk throughs (describing code to someone else)
