#### 3.1.1 Recruiting
- Craiglist (in US)
- your network
- cheaper for less speciales users
- if you can convince people you are imporving the world they might volunteer
- if they think is is for profict they will expect to be paid
- if you cant pay -> you cant use a token of appreciation

### 3.2 Process
- introduce yourself explaint he purpose
- the interview is about them, not you?
- begin with open, unbiased questions-> then follow up
- ask the questions, and let them answer
- have breaks and give them time
- have a clear separation between the general introduction, the actual interview, and post inteview discussions

### 3.3 Questions to avoid:
- leading questions
- what would they do / like / want in a hypothetical scenario

- avoid binary questions
