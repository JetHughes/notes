# Reading kanji

each character has two readings: japanese (onyomi) and chinese (kunyomi). 

kanji that appear togeteher are usually read with onyomi

kanji by themselves are read with kunyomi

some chars can have more than one onyomi or kunyomi

kunyomi is also used in adjectives and verbs as well as stand alone chars. they often also have a string of kana (called okurigana) that come attached to it.
