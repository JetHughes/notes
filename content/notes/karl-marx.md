# Marx
"religion is the opiate of the masses".

lived in the era after the enlightenment. Dividends of these ideas are being paid. Trade is more available. There is ever increasing demand. Small crafter gave way to manufacturers. Power is given to these people. Max's thinks this is bad.

Marx liked hegels dialectic:
- thesis
- antithesis
- synthesis

applied this to the economic history of the world. 

"the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles"

always two classes of people, rulers, and the exploited. rulers - thesis, exploited - anithesis, then revolution - synthesis. 

e.g.,
- slavery vs slave master
- peasants vs others

manufacturers - burgoise. others - politerate

we are the exploited class of this time period. rulers could be the big financial institutions

just because you dont feel exploited doesn't mean you aren't. 

why would anyone be satisfied with this arrangement? why should be accept that revolution is necessary.

rulers try to maximise their time in power. video games, movies, etc. distactin us from the world. 

ultimate method of distraction is religion



"religion is the opiate of the masses".



meant to mitigate the pain of being exploited. it is the ultimate fanstasy world. creates acceptance in the people. wverything is all "gods will". good for personal happiness, not good for society. 

the structure of the religion of a time period mirrors the current econmic tactic of coercion by the ruling class. 

e.g., 
- heirachical structure of feudal system matches the religion of the time - catholism. 
- capitalism - liberty. religion abandons heirachical structure.

tell the people "the rich go to hell".

individual moral progress is an illusion. the only thing that matters is the moral progress of society toward an end goal - the ideal society.
