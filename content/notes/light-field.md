A method of capturing all light rays of a scene so that it is possible to simulate different viewing angles. 

Light rays within a scene can be described by an origin $(x, y, z)$ as well as a direction $(\phi, \theta)$. This is the *plenoptic function*. The dimensionality is often reduced by encoding each ray as its point of intersection with two imaginary planes. Hence it becomes four dimension - $(s, t)$ and $(u, v)$
