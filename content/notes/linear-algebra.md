## Dot product
The dot product, also known as the scalar product or inner product, is a mathematical operation between two vectors that results in a scalar (a single value, not a vector). It is defined for vectors of the same dimension and measures the extent to which the two vectors are aligned with each other.

For two vectors **A** and **B** in n-dimensional space, the dot product is calculated by multiplying their corresponding components and summing the results. Mathematically, the dot product is denoted using a dot (·) or by placing the vectors adjacent to each other without any operator:

$A · B = A_{1}B1_{ }+ A_{2}B_{2} + ... + A_{n}B_{n}$

The dot product is commutative and distributive
