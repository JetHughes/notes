The users mental model is how the user thinks the interface works.

for example the fridge with two dials, or the doors.

The goal is for the design to create the correct mental model in the user. Designers often expect the user to have the same mental model as them, but this is not always the true. The users model is developed through iteraction with the system

This is why its important to have other people test the system.

A conceptual model mistach can lead to slow performance, erros, and frustration.

Mental models arise from experience, metaphor, and analogical reasoning. We can leverage what people have learnt from old interfaces to inform new ones. Our mental models are iconsistent, unstable in time, and often rife with superstition. 

# Slips vs Mistakes

A slip is when you have the right model but accidentally do the wrong thing.

A mistake is when you do what you intended, by you have the wrong mental model.

Slips with be prevented by improving ergonomics or visual design.

Mistakes can be prevented by providing better feedback and making options more clear.

re using existing designs reduced mistakes.

We should minimise the gap between current technology and new technology.
