- mental models are created by experience, metaphors, and analogical reasoning
- these models are developed further through interaction with the system
- designers (wrongly) often expect the users model to be the same as theirs

A mental model mistach leads to:
- slow performance
- errors
- frustration

[participant-observation](notes/participant-observation.md) appretiships (and other techniques such as [evaluating-designs](notes/evaluating-designs.md)) can uncover these mismatches.

	- leveraging real world metphors
