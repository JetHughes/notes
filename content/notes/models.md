> "A model is an informative representation of an [[object]], person or system"

[[software]] is made up of models. It is not only "code"
Models can be high level (mockups etc) or low level (code)
Models can be executable (code, ec) or not (diagrams)

Models are used in [domain-driven-design](notes/domain-driven-design.md) and in  [behaviour-driven-development](notes/behaviour-driven-development.md)
