C major - all white keys

you can play a different set of notes (a scale) over the base key. e.g., a blues-e (pentatonic something) solo over e major

root note - note that we start the scale on

major pattern - 2 wholetones 1 semitone 3 whole tones 1 semitone

numbering notes - each note in a scale is given a number: 1 is the root note, then 2, then 3 etc

accidental - a flat for sharp note

# Major vs minor
major - happy
minor - sad

usually

melodies with the pentatonic (remove 4th and 7th note) something are good
