Many different schools of thought. This is the perspective of the [[ARIVE-consortium|ARIVE]]

There is a conceptual and a technological way of looking at presence

More complicated than just latency, etc. 

- presence is more based around the human experience, cognition, emotion, etc
- immersion more on the technology side

Mel slater says there are two elements of presence:
- the place illusion. this is basically [[spatial-presence]] where we think our body is part of the environment
- the plausibility illusion. in the real world we dont need to consider this. in in VR we need to make sure than the environment is plausible

Holger says there are more factors
- fidelity
- drama (is there a plot/story)
	- name influenced by brenda lawrence computers as theatre
- interface awareness (is the inferface in the way)
- exploration (can we explore the environment)
- predictability (plausbility)

Holger says users experience these as three main thigs
- spatial presence (are we part of the environment)
- realism (lowest) (e.g., resolution doesn't make a huge different)
- involvement (do I feel engaged with the environment)

## Immersion
*fidelity of technical surroundedness*
Control 
• Display Types • Resolution • Field of View • Display frame rate • Latency • Noise/jitter

Measure
• units (specs, measured) • Perceived Fidelity • Perceived Surroundedness • “Fluidity” of interface • Perceived Flicker

## Presence
*sense of being there*
Control
• Immersion Factors • Plot / Drama • Interactivity • Coherence • Influence the suspension of disbelief

Measure
- Subjectively reported: Presence, • Co-Presence, • Social Presence, … 
- Observed: Actions, • Breaks, … 
- Measured: Heart rate, • GSR, …
