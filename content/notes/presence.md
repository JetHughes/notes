- I often felt as if I was all alone. 
- I think the other individual often felt alone.

- I hardly noticed another individual. 
- The other individual didn’t notice me in the room. 
- I was often aware of others in the environment. 
- Others were often aware of me in the room. 
- I think the other individual often felt alone.

## how to measure
- self report (dominant mode)
	- best questionnaire: IPQ
	- limitations
		- difference between what they say and what they actually think
		- can feeling be expressed properly
		- retrospective reporting
		- flaws in likert scales
- observation
	- mel slater real actions in virtual environments
	- also Regenbrecht, H. T., Schubert, T. W., & Friedmann, F. (1998). Measuring the sense of presence and its relations to fear of heights in virtual environments. International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 10(3), 233-249.
	- limitatons
		- actions must have a real world equivalent
		- less suitable for unprepared (vs lab study) environments
		- limited to what is observable
		- actions like blinking are indpendent of presence
- physiological
	- fMRI brain scan
	- EEG
	- pulse, heartrate, GSR
	- combinations
	- limitations
		- need instrumentation
		- Noisy data 
		  - You really, really need to know what you are measuring 
		  - Careful modelling and analysis required 
		  - Results/findings often borderline “esoteric" (cf Bennett, Miller, & Wolford, 2009)
