All documents in the project
- [[requirements]], design, technical etc

small group (10) number the documents
middle group (100), threads are needed
large group (1000), rigid structure needed

## Example
the OS/360 workbook
- Every programmer saw the whole book 
- Updated daily 
- Loose leaf folder approach 
	- Only changes were distributed (amended pages) 
	- Change sheets discussing changes 
- After six months 
	- Workbook was 5 feet thick! 
	- 100 copies distributed 
	- Daily change log about 2 inches (150 pages) 
	- Maintenance took a significant part of the day! 
- How would it be done today?

## Modern tools
- [[git]] wiki, bug tracker
