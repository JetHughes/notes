Rapid Prototyping can be compared to simulated annealing

## 1 Goals
- minimise time spent
- maximise information gained
	- cost of change increases with time
- help [stakeholders](stakeholders) understand ideas

## 2 Traits of a good prototype:
- not fully complete
- easy to change/create
- retired/evolved quickly

## 3 Insights gained from prototyping
- Feel -> Form
- Implementation -> Function
- Role -> Overall Experience
