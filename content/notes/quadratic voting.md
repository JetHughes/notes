Quadratic voting is a voting system in which individuals have a certain number of votes that they can distribute among options in any way they choose, but the number of votes required to support an option increases quadratically as the option becomes more popular. This is designed to give each individual more influence on less popular options and to prevent the majority from dominating the voting process.
