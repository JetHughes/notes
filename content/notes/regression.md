A type of [[supervised-learning]] model that involves the model to output a *continuous* (real number) value

## Linear regression
The model hypothesis is a weighted sum of inputs. Uses [[loss-function#least squares]] and [[loss-function#least squares]]

## Polynomial regression
The model hypothesis is a weighted sum of **polynomials** of inputs. Given training data, $(x,y)$, where $(x \in R)$ and $(y \in R)$ are real values, a polynomial of degree $k$ is a hypothesis

$\hat{y}-h(x, w)=w_k x^k+w_{k-1} x^{k-1}+\ldots+w_1 x+w_0$

 Uses [[loss-function#least squares]] and [[loss-function#least squares]]
