[[machine-learning]] where the agent receives data and generates actions in response. It can be thought of a combination of [[supervised-learning]] and [[unsupervised-learning]]

- agent is placed in an environment which provides a reinforcement signal, a positive or negative reward depending of the effects of the agents action
- a parameterised model mapping percepts to actions
- the agent generated sequences of actions recording their effects through percepts and any received reward(s).
- learning algorithm works out parameter values of the model that generate actions that maximise the rewards for a given situation (inferred from the percepts).
