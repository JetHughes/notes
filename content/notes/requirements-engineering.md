> “…to cover all of the activities involved in discovering, documenting, and maintaining a set of requirements for a computer-based system.�? - Kotonya and Sommerville, 2001, p. 8

Requirements engineering is a robust methodology for the development of requirements. It is made  up of three main steps.


# 1 Discovery

This is where you identify all the requirments of the system. [requirements-elicitation](notes/requirements-elicitation.md) is done here. Many techniques such as [interviewing](notes/interviewing.md), [participant-observation](notes/participant-observation.md), [prototyping](notes/prototyping.md), and more are used here.

This is also where you should learn about the domain of the system and the stakeholders

# 2 Documenting
This is where the requirements are specified and refined, and [[models]] and documents are created. All the requirements are compiled into a [requirements document](notes/requirements-document).

# 3 Maintenance
This occurs throughout development and is primarly focuses on managing changes in the environment of the system. 

It important to manage what is being discovered and documented. This allows you to keep the client updated and manage scope creep.
