# 1 What are they

> â€œâ€¦descriptions of how the system should behave, application domain information, constraints on the systemâ€™s operation, or specifications of a system property or attribute.â€?  - Kotonya and Sommerville, 2001, p. 6

> â€œâ€¦a statement of need, something that some class of user or other stakeholder wants.â€? - Alexander and Stevens, 2002, p. 8

Requirements are something an information system should do, or some constraint it should adhere to

There two types of requirements. Functional requirements specify what the system should do. And constraints, which limit the way in which the system should do those things.


# 2 How are they created

Requirements should be developed using the [requirements-engineering](notes/requirements-engineering.md) process. This process defined a robust way to develop requirements. It has three main steps: discovery, documenting, and maintenance. 

Requirements can be defined using the [FURPS](notes/furps) framework. However, this is usually overkill.

Requirements can be communicated through natural language, [models](notes/models.md), [prototyping](notes/prototyping.md), 
or even formal mathematical notation

Good requirements should adhere to  [these](notes/requirements-guidelines.md) guidelines.

Every development process has a different apporach to guidelines. ... #unfinished

# 3 What causes bad requirements

- domain and/or problem not well understood
- misnderstandings
- continually evolving or incomplete/abmiguous/inconsistent/overlapping/unimplementable requirements
