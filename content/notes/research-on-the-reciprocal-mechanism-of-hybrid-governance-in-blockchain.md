# Summary
This paper investigates the idea of reciprocal blockchain governance. It identifies two major processes of blockchain governance: 
- governance _of_ the BC – where stakeholders, and social market evaluate performance of BC and make improvements. This occurs off-chain
- governance _by_ the BC –  applying consensus protocols, and node control using BC as a medium. Occurs on chain

They propose that neither on-chain governance-by-BC nor off-chain governance-of-BC are sufficient and that these methods should be combined and used to inform each other. They note that this method is most effective within a partially decentralised consortium blockchain.

# Extracts


"A significant amount of research and development still remains before hybrid governance is achieved. However, the difficulty surrounding the task of managing rapidly developing technology can be alleviated best by incorporating technological advancements into the governance structure."
