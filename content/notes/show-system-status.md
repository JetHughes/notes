This is the first of neilsens ten usability heuristics. fr

- feedback depends on response time
	- <1s just show outcome
	- ~1s feedback that activity is underway
	- >>1s show fractional progress time 

- 0.1 seconds --> feels instantaneusly
- 1 second --> about the limit for flow to be uinteruippted
- 10 seeconds --> the limit for keeping users attention

when:
- when action is requried
- show storage space
- making changes
- next steps --> user input required
- completion --> some task has finished
