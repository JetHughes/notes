A field of study within [[optical-see-through|OST]] [[head-mounted-display|HMDs]]

It is focuses on making virtual objects appear to be correctly places in physical space in the real world.

## Display Calibration

SPAAM
- The users is asked to align points on the display with marker points in the real world. 
- We can use this to calculate the relationship between the users eyes and the display

Interaction free
- can use eye tracking
- compute a model of the eye and approximate the display surface
- compute continuous alignment

## Distortion Correction
The optics with OST displays are not always perfect and often have distortions.

For example, in some [[head-mounted-display|HMDs]] the image plane is spherical.
