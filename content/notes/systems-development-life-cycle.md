Provides overall framework for managing the systems
There are many methodologies to help guide us through this cycle
Each methodology sits on the [predictive-adaptive-spectrum](notes/predictive-adaptive-spectrum.md)
A very common methodology at the moment is [agile](agile.md)

## 1 Phases
### 1.1 Analysis 
^2d7976
- Lots of communication with [stakeholders](notes/stakeholders.md)
- Gather detailed information
- define system requirements
- prioritise requirements (what is risky, what brings value to business) -> increase proability of success
- develop UI dialogs ([prototyping](notes/prototyping.md)' where the user can interact with the system)
- evaluate requirments
- review reccomendations with management

## 2 Business process re-engineering
method of organising company
- streamline processes to be efficient and efffective
- question basic assumptions

use ICT to help with BPR 

sys analyst may find opportunites to improve processes
- any project can include components of BPR

simpler business processes -> simpler requirements -> simpler system

## 3 Requirements
- [requirements](notes/requirements.md)
- [requirements-elicitation](notes/requirements-elicitation.md)
- Something the system should do 
- Some constraint the system should have
- Can be functional or non functional
- Good requirements prevent failure

## 4 SDLC Variations
- different terminology
- change focus on people
- change speed of development
	- [prototyping](notes/prototyping.md)
	- Rapid application development (RAD)

## 5 Failure
main goal: Avoid project failure
- complete fail implies nothing delivered
- Types of fail
	- cost overruns
	- sw quality issues
	- missed deadlines
	- unhappy [stakeholders](notes/stakeholders.md)

Suprisingly very common with large projects
