A field of study within [[optical-see-through|OST]] [[head-mounted-display|HMDs]] focuses on reducing latency and flicker. 

latency is the main cause of simulator sickness. Displays should aim for refresh rate of less than 5ms

Critical flicker frequency is about 90hz

For reference MS hololens: 60hz, 15ms
