TIPS
- do-confirm vs read-do
- clear
- simple
- fast
- flexibility in performing key points, but stop at critical steps
- doesn't need to be written and marked off
- trim the list as much as possible
- clear pause point to use the checklist
- 5-9 items - not too strict
- longer than 60-90 seconds people start shortcutting
- killer items - most important and easy to miss
- simple and exact wording
- fit on one page
- no unnecessary font/colors
- has to be tested in the real world

three types of problems
- simple > like baking a cake from a recipe
	- "Sometimes there are a few basic techniques to learn. But once these are mastered, following the recipe brings a high likelihood of success"
- complicated > sending a rocket to the moon
	- "They can sometimes be broken down into a series of simple problems. But there is no straightforward recipe. Success frequently requires multiple people, often multiple teams, and specialized expertise. Unanticipated difficulties are frequent. Timing and coordination become serious concerns"
- complex > raising a child
	- "Once you learn how to send a rocket to the moon, you can repeat the process with other rockets and perfect it. One rocket is like another rocket. But not so with raising a child, the professors point out. Every child is unique. Although raising one child may provide experience, it does not guarantee success with the next child. Expertise is valuable but most certainly not sufficient. Indeed, the next child may require an entirely different approach from the previous one. And this brings up another feature of complex problems: their outcomes remain highly uncertain. Yet we all know that it is possible to raise a child well. It’s complex, that’s all."

many simple problems with many steps are error prone. people forget steps. they are amenable to "forcing functions": straightforward solutions that force the necessary behaviour

always a decision: follow protocol or just do it ⇒ get the stupid stuff right but allow room for creativity and individual judgement

checklists in building:
- used to be a "master builder who knew everything"
- building became very complex
- people and to specialize and work together
- e.g., labour, archiecture, engineering
- use checklists to organise 
	- construction tasks checklist
	- communication task checklist


van halen m&m clause
- a bowl of m&m'm backstage with brown candies removed
- van halen was the first band to take huge productions into tertiary third level markets
- the contract rider was huge
- buried somewhere in the middle of it was the m&m clause
- if they find a brown m&m they line check the entire production and pretty much 100% of the time they find something wrong

> [!QUOTE] under conditions of true complexity—where the knowledge required exceeds that of any individual and unpredictability reigns—efforts to dictate every step from the center will fail. People need room to act and adapt. Yet they cannot succeed as isolated individuals, either—that is anarchy. Instead, they require a seemingly contradictory mix of freedom and expectation—expectation to coordinate, for example, and also to measure progress toward common goals
