# Transistors
![simple transistor diagram|100](https://i.imgur.com/oBuNR9m.png)

- B: Base ⇒ A swtich connecting C to E
	- open (C is disconnected from E) when supplied 0v
	- closed (C is connected to E) by applying +5V
- C: Collector
- E: Emitter

Possible to create NAND gate using just transistors ∴ possible to create all logic gates using only transistors [^3]


[^3] : They dont actually do it this way (see lab)
