##### best practices
- develop iteratively
- define and mange system requirements
	- effectively managing changes in [[requirements]]
- use component architectures
- create visual [[models]] (UML)
- verify quality 
- Control changes

##### Values and principles
Values:
- **individuals and interactions** over processes and tools 
- **working software** over comprehensive [[documentation]] 
- **customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **responding to change** over following a plan

Twelve modelling principles:

> Build only necessary [[models]] that are useful and at the right level of detail

- Software is your primary goal — don’t get distracted by
documentation or [[models]].
- The next effort is your secondary goal — be aware of next
step versions or revisions.
- Minimise modelling — only build what helps move the project
forward.
- Embrace change, change incrementally — take small steps
that keep you on track and that can be reversed if necessary.
- Model with a purpose — to understand and communicate.
- Build multiple [[models]] — look at problems from different
perspectives.
- Build high-quality [[models]] and get feedback — from [stakeholders](stakeholders), other developers.
- Focus on content, not representation — always focus on stakeholder needs; informal hand-drawn [[models]] are often fine.
- Communicate and learn from each other.
- Know your [[models]] and how to use them.
- Adapt to specific project needs.
- Maximise stakeholder ROI.
