A hypothesis $h(X,w)$ for which gives a consistent fit to any dataset.

for classification this mean it can label any data and is called a **universal classfier**

fofr regression this means it can git any data to an arbitrarily small [[mean-squared-error]]

However it prone to [[overfitting]]]]

A weighted sum of inputs is not universal. It can only fit linearly separable data. We can make data [[linearly-separable]] by aligning points on a hyperplane. This is called transforming the data into a [[feature-space]]
