[[machine-learning]] where the agent receives a set of training data and has to work out what regularities it contains

- a sample on unlabelled data is given
- a parameterised model is chosen
- the learning algorithm works out parameters of the model that "organised/categorises" data according to some chosen criteria

For example we can use [[principle-component-analysis]] to extract the most important patterns/features of the data
