trying to call a function of a smart contract. I suspect its not working because the function signature hash is wrong

Battled the smart contract all day yesterday. Might take a break from that and try to do something else

who generates the keys for a new node?

what if a node removes itself

Implemented a test to remove a node. 

What about forking. do you remove a group of nodes?

https://blockchaingov.eu focused more on the legal side of things and the sociological issues.

Holochain is interesting. Framework for peer for peer apps. Apps built on holochain connect users devices directly in a p2p network. Data created by each user is digitally signed and stored in their device. The apps defines rules about what valid data looks like. The network of peers makes up the entire Distributed Hash Table (DHT), where each peer has a small, random 'shard' of the DHT. 

How does the blockchain work? How does it achieve consensus? Is it BFT? 

How could we use this for veracity? We could make a holochain app.

www.kaleido.io: blockchain as a service

meeting
- removing participant
	- security risks (whats stopping them from rejoining)
	- remove permanently vs temporarily
- skeptical of decentralised storage:
	- less protections
	- tradeoff availablility vs confidentiality
- maybe dig into holochain "data rules" used for validation

I need to have a more skeptical mindset.

Why cant we use blockchain as a service (blockstream, kaleido, alchemy, aws, IBM). Is it up to me to look into this and decide if we can rule it out?

Quorum: developed by jp morgan for finance applications. It is a fork of go-ethereum. Add the ability to have private contracts and transactions which are only visible/viewable by participants specifies in the transaction. 

R3 Corda: open source permissioned platform. Follow know your customer principle. each node must prove identity. verified by the  _doorman_ node. Network is made up of one or many _notary_ nodes which validate the uniqueness and sequencing of transactions without global broadcasting. two types of consensus: validity and sequencing,
