david chalmers. 

- real world may be replaced by VR
- book reality+
- the hard problem of conciousness
- the point where vr feels like real life
- vr is not a "fake reality" 
- no way to know if we are in a simulation
- BCIs
- even simple interactions in VR are "real"
- "pursuit of reality may become novel or a fetish"
- potential health issues
- psychological damage (if we are better looking and have better clothes and a nicer home in the metaverse,Â [how will we feel when we leave](https://time.com/6128706/frances-haugen-metaverse-facebook/)?)
- athenticity in interacting in our physical form
- 

idk it seems "hypey" looking to far in the future
