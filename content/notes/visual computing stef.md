Visual computing for XR

[[computer-graphics]], [[human-computer-interaction|HCI]], [[artificial-intelligence|AI]], visualization [[computer vision]]

## [[AR]] visualisation
raw data (filtering) focus data (mapping) geometric data (rendering) image
for AR need to combine raw data with environment


data: geometric data (mesh), camera image, registration data.

challenges with visual coherence: 
	- occlusion 
	- shadows
	- height in visual field (depth)
	- relative size
	- cluttering
		- geometric alignment, and occlusion  

 
contextual data. with 3d models we can occlude.

some system do online real time 3d reconstruction for occlusion. and also identify and label objects in the scene

ghosting map to show pipes underground. (edges, saliency, texture details, etc)

2.5D is stereo -> 2d image with depth
