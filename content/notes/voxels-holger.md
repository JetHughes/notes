questions
- how do the cameras reconstruct the people?


voxels vs pixels: exam: on a regular grid and gap less. regular grid with index is more dense than normal points. voxels are very compact.

oct trees can be used. however they are better for static objects than moving ones. we can deal with dynamic objects though


to select people/trim voxels:
- green screen
- depth selection
- skeleton method

skeleton method:
- only capture skeleton and rig with a texture

medical patient training VR
- good because you can collaborate and be together with colleagues
