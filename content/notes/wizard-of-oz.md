making interactive app quickly with minimal code

simulate interactive behaviour with human operators

- make interactive app without much code
	- front end interface
	- remote wizard controls user interface
	- makes sense with is faster/cheaper/easier than making the real thing
- get feedback from users people
	- hi-fi users think its more real
	- low-fi: more license to suggest changes

## 1 making wizard protoypes
- find scenarios to protoypes
- create UI skeleton
- develop hooks for wizard input
- decide where and how the wizard will provide input
	- remember not to fake stuff that it not feasible in real life
- rehearse wizard rile with colleague

## 2 running wizard protoypes
- practivce with friend
- recruit users

- two roles:
	- facilitator ⇒ pprovides tasks and takes notes
	- wizard ⇒ operaties interface

- user feedback
	- think aloud
	- retrospective
	- heuristic evaluation

- debrief users


## 3 used throughout development
user can do less and less and the prototyp comes closer to realisation

## 4 advatages
- fast
- variable
- more real than papar prototypes
- finds bugs and pronlems with design
- places user at center
- can envision challenging to built application
- ability to look foward and "use" tech that isn't created yet


## 5 Disadvatages
- simulations may misrepresent otherwire imperfect tech
- mya simulate techs that not not exist (and mnay never)
- require training and can be inconsistent
- playing the wizard can be exhausting
- some features are difficult to simulate
- may not be appropriate
